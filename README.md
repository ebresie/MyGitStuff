# MyGitStuff
This is a Git Repository on Git Hub to place stuff I want to put under git control.  It is not specific to any particular project per say but more a place to put files that I'd like to make available across locations so I can access them on different computers, tables, phones, etc.  For any real projects, I would create a separate project/Repository.
